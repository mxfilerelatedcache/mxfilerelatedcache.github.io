						<h2>Help your fellow citizens to stay healthy</h2>
						<p> The spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the COVID-19 pandemic seem are an imminent threat to society. Collectively wearing masks in public helps to reduce the spread of COVID-19. However, governments struggle to provide enough masks and citizens refrain from wearing them, despite their effectiveness if worn collectively (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3591312/">Source</a>). To solve this problem, we came up with a simple idea. Most of you might have paper and a printer. And probably a rubber band. That's all you need to build your own mask. Just print it out, fold it and help us to stay save as a society, together!</p>
